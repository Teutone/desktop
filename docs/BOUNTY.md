# The Musicoin Bounty Program

Musicoin ($MUSIC) Desktop Wallet(MDW) is an open source project to support end users to transfer $MUSIC between wallets.

The Bounty program seeks to reward innovative new ideas that can be of use to the Musicoin ecosystem. Issues that have a bounty are marked with two labels. One, a cyan bounty label denoting that an issue has a bounty reward associated with it. Two, the bounty reward in $MUSIC. If you are interested in taking up an issue, submit a PR, there is no need to claim the issue or request to be assigned unless specified so.

## Contributing

1. Quality is preferred over quantity but that doesn't mean we won't help you out with your new idea.
2. We would be more than happy to lend assistance if need be. You can find us at the official Slack or at `team@musicoin.org`.
3. To claim your bounty, you're required to sign the Musicoin CLA. This will be presented to you if your PR is merged. Translation PRs don't require you to sign the CLA.
4. New ideas can be submitted at any time and the team will review and assign appropriate bounties.
5. Teamwork is encouraged, if two people work together to fix an issue, both will be rewarded in proportion to their contribution.
6. Comment and fully document your work if possible, it helps future contributors understand the code better.

The bounty program is open for all, beginner or experienced. The awarded amount may increase depending on the difficulty and urgency of the issue presented. All decisions regarding bounties are final and are solely at the discretion of the Musicoin core team.
